        <h3>My Story</h3>
        <p>
          Ever since I was a little kid, machinery and electronic gadgets have interested me. I still remember the day when I was five, my brother and I were playing pinball on Windows 95. We were excited and having fun playing our first computer game. Suddenly, the screen started to flicker and randomly out of nowhere we got the blue screen of death. We were clueless as to what had happened and were very upset that we could not play our game. Thus, we called our uncle who was an electronics engineer at that time. He began to inspect the desktop and found that the OS had somehow rendered itself into an unusable state. As I watched him fix the computer, I began to ponder how a physical object interacted with something intangible to display images on a screen. This experience piqued my curiosity and ignited my passion for computers and technology.

        <h3>My Journey</h3>
        <p>
          I was born and raised for majority of my life in Mumbai (formerly Bombay), India. Back home, I attended schools that followed the British schooling system. After completing two years of high school, I moved to the United States with my family in 2009. I attended Neuqua Valley High School, where I got an opportunity to explore my interests by taking various technology, mechanics, and engineering electives. I joined clubs and organizations that aligned with my interests and passions. This gave me an opportunity to apply the concepts and theories discussed in class and get hands on learning experience.
