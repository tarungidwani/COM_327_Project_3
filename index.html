        <h3>My Passion</h3>
        <p>
          Technology has become an integral part of individual lives and socitey as a whole. It is a very important, fast-paced, and constantly changing, improving and evolving field. I strongly believe that in order to keep pace with the rapid technological advancements, one must be open  and willing to explore, learn, and utilize the right technological tool for the job as opposed to sticking to technologies that are older or within ones comfort zones. Possessing a strong bias or preference towards a certain technology, platform or prgramming  langauge prevents hinders one's judgement when determining how to complete some or all tasks. Failure to embrace new and different kinds technologies can potentially lead to the obsoletion of one as a professional or educator in the field of technology.

          Currently, I am a student at Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago,IL. I am majoring in computer science with a minor in system administration. I feel that along with learning how to engineer robust, efficient, and reusable systems it is equally important to have a working understadning and knowledge about the infrastrcuture these systems will be housed on. This would allow me engineer systems that leverage the infrastrcuture to the their full potential and in turn creating a more ecnomic, robust, and effective technology-centric eco-system for any organization.

        <h3>My Aspirations</h3>
        <p>
          During my time at Illinois Institute of Technology, I aspire to learn and explore many different facets in the field of Computer Science. I am planning on working with professors on their research in these fields as a research assistant. This will give me an opportunity to learn in depth about a specific field and get some hands on experience by contributing to the research projects. I am also looking for an internship to get acquainted with how things work in the industry. Working in the industry will allow me to put my learnings from the classroom into practice and gauge my interests and disinterests.
        </p>

          After graduation, I hope to work in the industry for a few years as a full-stack software engineer. Applying the teachings from this course, will aid me in becoming a proficient front-end developer and in turn allow me to be an overall well-rounded software engineer. The work experience will help me discover my passions before pursuing graduate school. I have a passion for both academia and industry, so I would like to teach at the university level and continue working in the industry.
